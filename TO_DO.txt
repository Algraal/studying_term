1. In real terminal unmatched '(' is not an error. In this case terminal expects for user input until ')'
is entered. I should write preanalysis of raw input.

+ BUG IN input_to_commands. Probably indexing to addresses that do not belong to the string. 

find, rfind can be changed to find_if 

() and {} does not work as I thought. input_to_command should be reworked. 

I have to add new class to group processes. -- split_brackets function is comment out. Spliting into groups
will be implemented later (after pipes and zombie handlers).

For class commands new methods should be implemented for handling different types of execution, 
e.g. commands.bg_mode_execute(), commands.and_execute() and so on.
