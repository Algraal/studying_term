1. In real terminal unmatched '(' is not an error. In this case terminal
expects for user input until ')' is entered. I should write preanalysis 
of raw input.

+ BUG IN input_to_commands. Probably indexing to addresses that do not
belong to the string. 

find, rfind can be changed to find_if 

() and {} does not work as I thought. input_to_command should be reworked. 

I have to add new class to group processes. -- split_brackets function
is comment out. Spliting into groups will be implemented later
(after pipes and zombie handlers).

+ For class commands new methods should be implemented for handling different
types of execution, e.g. commands.bg_mode_execute(), commands.and_execute()
and so on.

Change execute_commands it should handle delimitres.
If delimiter is "&&" and current process failes the next one should be
skipped.

+ bg_mode handling is added
+ no delimiter handling is added

Add proper zombie handler using s SIGCHLD (I do not know if waitpid removes
zombies of a different process in my case)

+ Add to bg_mode_execute printing out pid of process.

CD command should be handled differenly for background mode (should 
actually fork, change directory, exit). For "(  )" case should be provided
new tools (like group class or something)

Refactor split_into_tokens. is_pos_quoted can be implemented differently
